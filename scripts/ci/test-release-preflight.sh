# Self-test for scripts/ci/release-preflight.sh checks 1, 3 and 4
# (issues #3308, #3309, #3338 and #3339).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   Check 3 measures whether main's last Docker Publish published its manifest.
#   It used to `warn` on a red result and let the script exit 0, so the tool
#   printed "a tag cut will likely stall" and "READY: ... Safe to cut the tag."
#   in the same run. That is worse than no preflight, because it launders a
#   measured red into an explicit go-ahead.
#
#   The failure is invisible to any test that only checks the happy path: with
#   a GREEN Docker Publish the buggy and the fixed script are identical. So the
#   case that must be covered is specifically the MEASURED-RED one, and the
#   test has to be able to fail. Revert the measured-red branch's `bad` back to
#   `warn` and case 2 below goes red; that is the property being asserted.
#
# HOW
#   The script reaches GitHub only through `gh`. We put a stub `gh` first on
#   PATH that replays canned job conclusions, so no network and no repo state
#   is involved. Checks 1 and 2 are neutralised (a temp repo with a matching
#   version set and no release/* branches) so the exit code isolates check 3.
#

# --- check 4 fixture --------------------------------------------------------
#   Check 4 asks: is this component's pinned version tag already published from

#   1.2.2 while #3315 had re-pinned the trivy base image in
#   docker/Dockerfile.scanner-adapter. The tag's Docker Publish refused to
#   republish 1.2.2, which skipped every remaining manifest and stopped the
#   release chain on an immutable tag that then had to be deleted by hand.
#
#   The reason this needs a pre-tag check rather than trusting CI: the publish
#   job only evaluates the exact tag when `stable_requested` is true, which
#   needs a clean `refs/tags/v*`. Docker Publish on main passed on the very
#   same commit, and an `-rc.N` tag would have passed too. So the green path
#   here is not the interesting one -- case 2 is, and it must be able to fail.
#   Revert `bad` to `warn` on the changed-sources branch of check 4 and it goes
#   red.
