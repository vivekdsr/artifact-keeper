# Pre-tag release readiness check (issue #3042).
#
# Run this BEFORE cutting a release/RC tag (see RELEASING.md). It asserts that
# THE REF BEING CUT is actually releasable, so a stale tree does not cost a
# full re-cut cycle. The motivating incident (#3039): v1.7.0-rc.1 stalled ~90 minutes at
# docker-publish's Security Scan because `main` was missing two trivy-CLI CVE
# suppressions that lived only on `release/1.6.x` (#2997/#3040). Security Scan
# HARD-gates the multi-arch manifest, which gates resolve-candidate-digest,
# which gates the ENTIRE release-gate chain -- so a missing suppression turns
# into a silent 90-minute stall with a draft release at the end. The signal was
# already visible (`Docker Publish [push/main]` had been red for 5 commits);
# nothing checked it before tagging. This gate is that check.
#
# What it verifies:
#   1. TRIVYIGNORE DRIFT (hard): every suppression on every active `release/*`
#      branch must be ACCOUNTED FOR on main -- either as a live suppression
#      token, or as an explicit `# RETIRED: <token>` tombstone line. A CVE
#      suppressed on a hotfix branch and neither carried nor tombstoned on
#      main means main's images fail Security Scan -> no release can be cut
#      from main. This is the exact #3039 gap. Enumeration mirrors
#      check-migration-ledger.sh.
#
#      This one check is MAIN-CENTRIC and is skipped (loudly) when the audited
#      ref is a `release/*` branch. Its subject is "can a cut from main clear
#      Security Scan given what the maintenance branches suppress"; a
#      maintenance branch's own images are scanned against its OWN
#      .trivyignore, so another branch's suppressions say nothing about it and
#      the branch comparing against itself is vacuous. Running it anyway would
#      manufacture drift findings that no cut from that branch can act on.
#
#      The tombstone form exists because a plain superset rule makes the set
#      monotonic (#3309): a suppression provably dead for main's images could
#      never be DELETED while any release branch still listed it, so the file
#      drifted from "the residual set" toward "everything ever worked
#      around". A `# RETIRED: <token>` line is the machine-read record that
#      main removed the token DELIBERATELY (the finding is absent from main's
#      images), as opposed to never having received it (the #3039 forward-port
#      miss, which still hard-fails). Retiring is a reviewable diff, and a
#      token listed BOTH live and retired is a contradiction and fails.
#   2. VERSION-SET CONSISTENCY (hard): the workspace version in Cargo.toml,
#      the OpenAPI info version in backend/src/api/openapi.rs, and the
#      artifact-keeper-backend entry in Cargo.lock must all agree. A partial
#      bump ships a stale version string (see RELEASING.md step 2).
#   3. DOCKER-PUBLISH HEALTH FOR THIS COMMIT (hard, when it can be measured):
#      whether the `Docker Publish` run for the EXACT commit being tagged
#      (HEAD) published its multi-arch manifest (i.e. Security Scan passed).
#      A red/skipped manifest here does not merely "predict" the same stall
#      on the tag -- it is the same job, on the same images, with the same
#      gate. If it is red, the cut stalls.
#
#      Selection is by `head_sha`, NOT by recency (#3338). "Latest run on
#      main" is a proxy that diverges from the question that matters whenever
#      main has moved since the last publish, a publish is still in flight,
#      or the list API answers stalely -- the v1.7.2 cut lost time to a
#      blocking false red when the "latest run" query returned a ten-day-old
#      run while the actual latest (and green) run existed. A tag is cut on a
#      commit; the commit's own run is the measurement.
#
#      This check used to `warn` and let the script exit 0, so the tool printed
#      "a tag cut will likely stall" and "READY: ... Safe to cut the tag." in
#      the same breath (#3308). That is worse than having no preflight, because
#      it launders a measured red into an explicit go-ahead -- exactly the
#      "gate failure is cosmetic, promote anyway" reasoning the release freeze
#      was written to remove after the v1.5.8 integrity failure.
#
#      Note the asymmetry this fixes. Check 1 (trivyignore drift) is a PROXY
#      for "will Security Scan pass" and catches exactly one cause: a
#      suppression stranded on release/*. Check 3 is the DIRECT measurement.
#      Having the proxy hard and the measurement soft was backwards, and the
#      gap was reachable: on 2026-08-13 a newly-published advisory (#3307)
#      failed Security Scan on main while every hard check passed clean,
#      because the CVE affected main and the release branches equally so there
#      was no drift to find.
#
#      Outcomes, deliberately kept distinct -- "I did not look", "I could not
#      look", "there is nothing to look at yet" and "I looked and it is red"
#      are different claims:
#        * not measured (skipped, or `gh` absent)      -> note, not blocking
#        * could not measure (the gh query failed)     -> INFRA, exit 2
#        * no run for this commit (not built yet)      -> blocking, exit 1
#          NOT a pass and NOT "ran and failed": the images for this commit do
#          not exist, so a tag cut has nothing to resolve a digest from.
#        * run still queued/in progress                -> blocking, exit 1
#          (wait for it to finish and re-run; treating in-flight as absent
#          or as green would launder an unfinished measurement)
#        * measured red                                -> blocking, exit 1
#      PREFLIGHT_ALLOW_RED_PUBLISH only overrides the MEASURED-RED outcome:
#      "I looked, it is red, proceeding anyway" is a coherent human call.
#      There is no override for not-built/in-flight, because there is no
#      result to accept the risk of -- the digest resolution would simply
#      fail.
#
#   4. VERSION-PINNED IMAGE COLLISION (hard, when it can be measured): for each
#      component whose image tag comes from a checked-in VERSION file, whether
#      that exact tag is ALREADY published from different sources. Exact
#      version tags are never republished (#2457 / the v1.5.8 integrity
#      failure), so a changed component with an unbumped VERSION cannot
#      publish -- and the failure skips every remaining manifest, so
#      resolve-candidate-digest has nothing to pin and the whole release chain
#      stops.
#
#      The motivating incident: v1.7.2 was tagged on a commit where #3315
#      re-pinned the trivy base image inside docker/Dockerfile.scanner-adapter
#      but left docker/scanner-adapter/VERSION at 1.2.2. The tag's Docker
#      Publish failed with "1.2.2 already exists ... but scanner-adapter
#      sources changed", the chain stopped, and because the tag was immutable
#      it had to be deleted by hand.
#
#      Why nothing caught it earlier is the whole point of putting the check
#      HERE. The publish job derives `stable_requested` from the ref, and only
#      a clean `refs/tags/v*` (no hyphen) sets it. On main the job publishes
#      dev/sha tags and returns before the collision check; on a `-rc.N` tag it
#      does the same. So Docker Publish passed on main for the SAME commit, and
#      an RC would have passed too. The defect was reachable by exactly one
#      kind of run -- the real tag -- which is the most expensive place to
#      discover it and the one place it cannot be amended.
#
#      Same three-way outcome as check 3, for the same reason: a registry we
#      cannot read is not a registry that said yes.
#        * tag absent                                  -> ok, it will be created
#        * published, sources identical                -> ok (a rebuild may
#          still move the floating tags; the exact tag stays put)
#        * published, sources differ                   -> blocking, exit 1
#        * published, no provenance annotation         -> blocking, exit 1
#          (measured: the publish job hard-fails on this too)
#        * registry unreadable / commit unfetchable    -> INFRA, exit 2
#
# Exit-code contract (mirrors scripts/ci/check-migration-ledger.sh):
#   0  ready       -- no blocking problem found.
#   1  NOT READY   -- a real, blocking problem (drift, version mismatch, or a
#                     measured-red Docker Publish for the audited commit).
#                     Fix it on the ref being cut before tagging; NEVER retry
#                     it away.
#   2  INFRA       -- tooling/network failure (git ls-remote / gh / file reads
#                     failed); retryable, NOT a readiness verdict.
#
# Env overrides:
#   PREFLIGHT_REF    the ref this run is a statement about. Names the verdict
#                    line and decides whether check 1 applies. Defaults to the
#                    checked-out branch name; a detached HEAD reports as
#                    `HEAD`, which is not a `release/*` ref, so check 1 keeps
#                    its historical behaviour when nothing says otherwise.
#   PREFLIGHT_REPO   owner/name for the `gh api` calls (default: derived from
#                    the origin remote, else artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper).
#   PREFLIGHT_SKIP_DOCKER_HEALTH=1  do not run check 3 at all.
#   PREFLIGHT_ALLOW_RED_PUBLISH=1   run check 3, report a red result, but do
#                    not block on it. Deliberately SEPARATE from
#                    PREFLIGHT_SKIP_DOCKER_HEALTH: "do not look" and "I looked,
#                    it is red, proceeding anyway" are different decisions and
#                    should read differently in the transcript. Using this is a
#                    judgement call a human makes and owns; it is never a
#                    default, and it is not a way to make a red main green.
#   PREFLIGHT_SKIP_VERSION_PIN=1    do not run check 4 at all.
#   PREFLIGHT_TAG_STATE_CMD         path to the tag-presence probe
#                    (default .github/scripts/registry-tag-state.sh).
#   PREFLIGHT_TAG_REVISION_CMD      path to the tag-revision probe
#                    (default .github/scripts/registry-tag-revision.sh).
#                    Both exist so the self-test can replay canned registry
#                    answers without a network or a docker daemon.

# VERSION` is the only VERSION file in the repo. backend, web and openscap are
# tagged with the AK release semver taken from the git tag itself, so their
# exact tags cannot collide the same way -- a re-cut of an existing version is
# caught earlier, by assert-release-absent.sh / assert-stable-tag-free.sh. This
# is a list rather than a hardcoded component so that adding the second one is
# a one-line change instead of a rewrite.
